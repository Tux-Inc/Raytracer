## Introduction
This project aims to develop a rendering engine using ray tracing in a 3D scene.

We will provide an overview of the software architecture, features, and techniques used in the project.

The modular architecture of the Raytracer projectâ€™s code in C++ offers developers great flexibility to extend its functionality. Thanks to a carefully thought-out design, it is easy to add new elements such as geometric primitives, light sources, materials, or even additional graphics libraries.
Each component is independent and can be seamlessly integrated into the rendering engine, allowing developers to explore different approaches and easily enhance the Raytracer's capabilities according to their specific needs.

## Architecture
The figure below illustrates the high-level architecture of the Raytracer project. The rendering engine consists of several modular components.
